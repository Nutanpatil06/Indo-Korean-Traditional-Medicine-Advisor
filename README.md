## 🧠 What Is This Project?

**Indo-Korean Traditional Medicine Advisor** is a web application that helps users understand traditional herbal medicine in a **modern, safe, and personalized way**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This Project

Traditional medicine is widely used, but:

- People often don’t know which herbs are safe  
- Herb–medicine interactions can be dangerous  
- Reliable knowledge is scattered and hard to understand  
- There is no easy way to track progress over time  

I built this project to:

- Make traditional medicine accessible and understandable  
- Combine Korean and Indian healing systems  
- Put safety first  
- Show how technology can support holistic healthcare
